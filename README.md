# job-finding-webscraper-csv-implementation

 An improvement of my previous job finding webscraper.
It webscrapes Indeed, Gov and reed for jobs and returns the title, employer and link to apply to each job made to save me time.
This will check a csv file for the jobs they the user has already applied for and it will not return those to the user.
